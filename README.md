My code has two functional components: Cart and Items
In a real car dealership Items would correspond to Sales department and Cart would be accounting. I use hooks and I only call my components on the highest level. Items has a list of all the products and setState is used to create an empty cart. From then on both Cart and Items take in cart and setCart and the only state they have to communicate is cart. All car elements are inside items and I have helpers to filter and sort as needed. I don't need to change the products list nor I have to update state just show sub categories of the 12 cars hardcoded. In the program, the user can only trigger state changes when a different option in selected within the select HTML elements or if a button for setting cart is clicked/quantity of cars is changed. Items only shows cars and lets the user add them to cart, and the cars added to cart are communicated to Cart through state. Cart's function is to remove/edit quantity of cars, checkout, and aggregate prices. The aggregated prices, except the car total, are irrelevant since this business doesn't really exist(yet), and just serve a dummy function as to how it would look like.So, my organization is hooks on App.js and each component takes in cart and setCart set by useState, which is how items added or removed in cart are communicated between Cart and Items.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
